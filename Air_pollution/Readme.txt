#Dataset Description:

The dataset under consideration pertains to the assessment of air pollution and air quality for various cities and countries over the six-year period spanning from 2017 to 2022. 
The dataset exhibits a distinctive structure, wherein the information relating to both the country and the city is contained within a single column. Additionally, it is notable that the dataset contains numerous instances with missing or blank values.


#Project Overview:

This project is done by doing following steps:
1. Data collection: The initial phase involved the systematic gathering of relevant data from diverse sources. This process ensured a comprehensive dataset that served as the foundation for subsequent analyses.
2. Cleaning Data: Rigorous data cleaning procedures were implemented to rectify inconsistencies, errors, and missing values within the collected dataset. This critical step was essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analyses.
3. Loading Data into PowerBI: Following data cleaning, the refined dataset was seamlessly integrated into PowerBI, a robust business intelligence tool. This step facilitated the creation of a dynamic and interactive environment for visualizing and analyzing the data.
4. Creating Dashboard: Leveraging the capabilities of PowerBI, a visually intuitive and insightful dashboard was meticulously designed. The dashboard served as a centralized platform for presenting key metrics and trends derived from the underlying data.
5. Getting insight from Data: The final phase of the project involved a comprehensive analysis of the dashboard to extract meaningful insights. Utilizing the visualizations and analytics tools within PowerBI, patterns, correlations, and trends were identified, providing valuable information to inform decision-making processes.
